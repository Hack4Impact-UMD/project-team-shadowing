# ðŸ‘¥ Project Team Shadowing

## Introduction
For the next two weeks, you will keenly observe a project team's dynamics and progress by attending their weekly meetings. You will probably have the urge to act like a fly on the wall at these meetings... **please don't**! ðŸ˜„ We've already informed them that you will be active participants.

You probably joined Hack4Impact with a dream project team role in mind. This activity aims to see what it would be like to serve in your dream role through shadowing someone already in it. 

**Use this opportunity to learn more about members in your desired project team role and decide whether or not you'd be happy spending a whole semester (or more) in their shoes!**

> I actually applied for Bootcamp and the Product Manager (PM) role in Spring 2024. I exceeded the qualifications for the PM role on my written application and was the only Spring 2024 Bootcamp admit who'd also interviewed for a project team role. Though I did not end up becoming a PM in Spring 2024, I was still determined to graduate Bootcamp and join a project team the following semester as a PM. I shadowed a PM for my Bootcamp cohort's project team shadowing activity. However, I quickly learned that PMs in Hack4Impact work at a high level on their project teams to ensure long-term goals are met (they don't complete tasks). Though this is a critical role, I realized that I'd be much happier serving as a Tech Lead or Engineer since I've always loved getting my hands dirty and reading between the lines of a project. I now see myself pursuing a professional career in SWE, and my experiences at Hack4Impact after graduating from Bootcamp have greatly supported this goal! - Krishnan
